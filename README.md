`![r_1985900_StKE8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ca1fa90-db12-41f8-b3b1-dbbf2938bac0)```


A simple yet powerful CLI tool written in Python to generate **cryptographically secure passwords** and provide real-time **strength analysis**. Designed for developers, ethical hackers, sysadmins, and anyone serious about digital security.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Generates strong passwords of custom length
- 🔁 Ensures at least one **uppercase**, **lowercase**, **number**, and **special character**
- 🧠 Includes **strength analysis** (weak, medium, strong, very strong)
- 🔒 Uses `secrets` module for true randomness and security
- 🧪 Interactive and user-friendly command-line interface
- 💡 KeyboardInterrupt support for graceful exits

## 🛠️ How to Use

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sandeepyadav1122/StrongPass.git

```

python3 password.py
```

> 💡 No third-party libraries required. Works out of the box with Python 3.6+.

---

## 📌 Requirements

* Python 3.6 or higher
* Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows (with WSL or native Python)

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Asks the user for desired password length.
2. Ensures inclusion of all character types.
3. Uses `secrets.choice()` for randomness.
4. Shuffles the password to prevent pattern predictability.
5. Analyzes and displays password strength based on length and entropy.

---

## 🧩 Future Scope (Ideas to Expand)

* Option to copy password to clipboard
* Export to `.txt` or `.csv` with timestamps
* Add password history/log
* GUI version using Tkinter or PyQt
* Integration with password managers
